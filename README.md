## App Overview

Dinosaur and Mammoth discoveries can be filtered to show all discoveries, only dinosaur fossils, dinosaur tracks, or mammoth bones. When items are clicked in a list, its marker on the map animates and an info window opens above it displaying the name from Wikipedia. Clicking the night button puts the app in night mode.

## Future Directions

I'd like to add more sites to the mapp and create additional funcitonality that permits users to get directions when requested, pull up discoveries within a specified range, and add visited locations to a list of 'Places Been.'
